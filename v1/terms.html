        <h3>General Questions</h3>
        <p class="lite-header">When will the Civic crowdsale start?</p>
        <p>The crowdsale will start on June 21, at 9am EDT.</p>

        <p class="lite-header">Where and how will the Civic crowdsale take place?</p>
        <p>The crowdsale will happen through a widget that will appear on tokensale.civic.com when the crowdsale starts on June 21 at 9am EDT.</p>
        <p>To participate in the crowdsale, you will have to download the Civic App and register by providing Civic with your email address and phone number. The Civic App is available globally. To download the Civic App, search “Civic Secure Identity” in the App Store for iOS or in Google Play for Android. For both the iOS and Android app, you will be prompted to scan a QR code and provide your details during the crowdsale process. You may choose to setup your details for the crowdsale ahead of time. This can be done within the app on iOS or by scanning a test QR code on either iOS or Android. A test QR code is available at tokensale.civic.com. Please note that you do NOT need to register through the Civic website. Such registration is currently only available to US residents.</p>

        <p class="lite-header">Is there a minimum or maximum of CVC tokens I can buy during the general sale?</p>
        <p>The CVC tokens will be sold in purchase tiers ranging from $50 to $25,000 worth of tokens. To ensure broad distribution of the tokens, there will be fewer tokens available in purchase tiers of $10,000 and over with the majority of tokens available for purchase in the $100-$10,000 range of purchase tiers. You will be asked to select the USD value of tokens you are requesting to purchase from the drop-down menu before proceeding with the rest of the crowdsale process.</p>
        <p><b>Each participant will be allowed to make only one purchase in the crowdsale.</b> Please do not attempt to create multiple accounts on the Civic App to participate in the Crowdsale more than once or otherwise attempt any unauthorized access to the Crowdsale. We reserve the right to block or suspend access if we suspect any unauthorized access or any attempted unauthorized access, as well as to <b>cancel any purchase request if we suspect any manipulation of the crowdsale process.</b></p>
        <p><b>In order to ensure a broad and fair distribution of tokens, individuals who successfully purchased tokens from us during our pre-sale may not participate in the crowdsale.</b></p>

        <p class="lite-header">Which payment methods will be accepted in the crowdsale?</p>
        <p>Bitcoin (“BTC”) and Ether (“ETH”) will be the only methods of payment accepted in the crowdsale.</p>

        <p class="lite-header">Pricing and Exchange Rate Mechanism</p>
        <p>Tokens will be priced at USD 0.10 per token. You will be asked to select the USD value of tokens you are requesting to purchase from the drop-down menu. The USD amount you select in the drop-down menu will be converted to, and payable in, BTC or ETH.  The amount payable in BTC or ETH will be based on an exchange rate sourced from cryptocompare.com no more than 60 minutes prior to the time you make your selection.</p>

        <p class="lite-header">How will I know if my purchase was successful? Both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks are overloaded.</p>
        <p>For purchases made in BTC and ETH, we will deem a purchase to be successful when three confirmations have been received within six hours of the time that payment information is displayed to you during the crowdsale process. We reserve the right to refund your purchase if the transaction is processed after the six hour period lapses.</p>

        <p class="lite-header">What will I need in order to participate in the crowdsale?</p>
        <p>You will need the following:</p>
        <p>1. Download the Civic App and register with Civic by providing your phone number and email address. To download the app, search “Civic Secure Identity” in the App Store for iOS or on GooglePlay for Android.</p>
        <p>2. If you are paying in BTC:</p>
        <p>A) Your BTC on an exchange or in a wallet, ready to be sent to the address displayed to you via the crowdsale widget. </p>
        <p>B) Your BTC refund address which is your receiving address.</p>
        <p>C) Your ERC20 compatible wallet address (please see examples of such wallets in the Technical Questions section below)</p>
        <p>3. If you are paying in ETH:</p>
        <p>A) Your ETH in an ERC20 compatible wallet (Note: It will NOT be possible to send ETH from an exchange)</p>

        <p class="lite-header">How many CVC tokens will be available in the crowdsale and how many created in total?</p>
        <p>Through pre-sales and the crowdsale commencing on June 21, Civic will have made a total of 330 million CVC tokens available for purchase at a price per token of $0.10 for a total of $33 million worth of tokens. Civic has reserved 110 million of the tokens, or $11 million worth of tokens, for purchase in the crowdsale.</p>
        <p>Civic is creating a total supply of 1 billion (1,000,000,000) CVC tokens, of which: 33% will be available for purchase as described above, 33% will remain in the Company’s inventory, 33% will be allocated to an incentivization supply, and 1% will be used to cover token sale costs.</p>

        <p class="lite-header">Are there any bonuses or discounts available for this crowdsale?</p>
        <p>No bonuses, discounts, or other incentives of any kind are available for the crowdsale.</p>

        <p class="lite-header">Where can I read the Civic whitepaper in full?</p>
        <p>The whitepaper is available at <a>https://tokensale.civic.com/whitepaper</a></p>

        <p class="lite-header">Will there be a lock-up on tokens sold in the token sale?</p>
        <p>No, there will be no lock-up for any of the tokens purchased in either the pre-sale or the crowdsale.</p>

        <h3>Technical Questions</h3>
        <p class="lite-header">Which wallets can I use?</p>
        <p>Please view the list below for compatible wallets. If you choose to purchase tokens with BTC, you can send BTC from an Exchange but need to provide us with a token receipt address that is ERC20 compatible (see the list of ERC20 compatible wallet below). If you choose to purchase tokens with ETH, the ETH must be sent by an ERC-20 compatible wallet. You must enter data input and gas limit values for a successful transaction. Please reference compatible wallets and the sample transaction screenshot below.</p>

        <p class="lite-header">I sent from a wallet and I have the private key, can I still get my tokens?</p>
        <p>Yes, see the instructions for recovery of the private key below.</p>

        <p class="lite-header">I sent from a wallet and I do not have the private key, can I still get my tokens?</p>
        <p>If this happens, please contact tokensale@civic.com as soon as possible. However, Civic is not responsible for any delays, losses, costs, expenses, or other issues relating to or arising from the loss of your private key or any other access credentials.</p>

        <p class="lite-header">My token receiving address does not support ERC20 and I do not have the private key?</p>
        <p>You must get in touch with us about a correction to your address before the distribution ends. Please email tokensale@civic.com with all information regarding your payment including transaction id, email, and name.</p>

        <p class="lite-header">I didn’t use enough gas what can I do?</p>
        <p>The transactions should have been rejected or not mined, your balance has not changed. Please try again with enough gas, set to: 250000</p>

        <p class="lite-header">I didn’t use the data field what can I do?</p>
        <p>The transaction is rejected and please check your balance and send with the correct data field.</p>

        <p class="lite-header">I sent Ethereum from an exchange for the pre-sale or crowdsale, what can I do?</p>
        <p>The transaction will be returned because of no data field. If the funds do not show up in your exchange wallet please contact the exchange’s support with the details of your transaction to see if you can get credit back for the transaction.</p>

        <p class="lite-header">Where can I purchase ETH?</p>
        <p>There are many exchanges that sell Ethereum for fiat or cryptocurrency, these include: </p>
        <p>Coinbase, Poloniex, Kraken, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Bittrex, Cex.io</p>
        <p><b>Please send your purchased ETH to a compatible wallet whose private keys you own and control, before sending to the crowdsale</b></p>

        <p class="lite-header">Where can I purchase BTC?</p>
        <p>There are many exchanges that sell Bitcoin for fiat or cryptocurrency, these include: </p>
        <p>Coinbase, Poloniex, Kraken, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Bittrex, Cex.io</p>

        <p class="lite-header">The Android App is asking for a PIN code - what is this?</p>
        <p>The Android app defaults to using the system level security mechanism you’ve configured (PIN, passcode, fingerprint, etc.) You must enter this passcode before proceeding. Civic will be adding the ability to set an app-specific passcode in a future update.</p>

        <p class="lite-header">I didn’t see an answer to my question.</p>
        <p>Send a request to tokensale@civic.com and we will try to address your question.</p>

        <p class="lite-header">Participating in the crowdsale with ETH</p>
        <p>1. Buy ETH on a cryptocurrency exchange, unless already owned.</p>
        <p>2. Transfer ETH to a compatible wallet (see below)</p>
        <p><a>MyEtherWallet</a> (no download needed), <a>Mist</a> (Desktop), <a>Parity</a> (Desktop), <a>imToken</a> (iPhone), <a>imToken</a> (Android), <a>Jaxx</a> (Integrated Support Coming Soon)</p>
        <p>3. Send a deposit to the payment address displayed through the crowdsale widgetwith correct data and gas limit values</p>

        <p class="lite-header">Participating in the crowdsale with BTC</p>
        <p>1. Buy BTC on a cryptocurrency exchange, unless already owned.</p>
        <p>2. Set up an ERC20 compatible wallet</p>
        <p>3. Locate your BTC refund address (which is your receiving address) and your ERC20 compatible wallet address for receipt of tokens</p>
        <p>4. Provide your refund and token receipt addresses and send the deposit to the payment address displayed through the crowdsale widget</p>

        <p class="lite-header">Example public crowdsale contribution in ETH</p>
        <p>Crowdsale deposit transactions need to have non-default gas limit (a.k.a. transaction maximum gas). This is because crowdsale transactions are more complex than simple Ethereum transfer transactions. The default gas limits is too low to correctly perform a crowdsale deposit.</p>
        <p>To participate in an Ethereum crowdsale you need to fill your transaction in with following details</p>
        <p>1) <b>Address</b> - this is given you on the crowdsale payment information page.</p>
        <p>2) <b>Data</b> - this is your personal reference number and it changes for every transaction. Do not share this with others. If you leave data field out than your transaction is rejected.</p>
        <p>3) <b>Gas limit:</b> 250000 - gas tells that this is a smart contract transaction and is more expensive than normal Ether transfer.</p>
