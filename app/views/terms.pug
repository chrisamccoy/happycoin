        p
          | Crowdsale deposit transactions need to have non-default gas limit (a.k.a. transaction maximum gas). This is because crowdsale transactions are more complex than simple Ethereum transfer transactions. The default gas limits is too low to correctly perform a crowdsale deposit.
        p
          | To participate in an Ethereum crowdsale you need to fill your transaction in with following details
        p
          | 1)

        p
          | 3) 
          b Gas limit:
          |  250000 - gas tells that this is a smart contract transaction and is more expensive than normal Ether transfer.
