  p ‚ÄúThe Crypto Finance Conference in St. Moritz, Switzerland was a special moment for us. We‚Äôve been in very deep R&D these past few months, with feedback‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääoutside of our team‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcoming only from a small group of advisors and friends. The opportunity to share our consensus algorithm, Dynamic Proof of Stake‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand our vision for global payments infrastructure‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand for it to be received it so well, meant a lot. We left the conference with new friends and a new set of believers in our protocol,‚Äù McCoy said.

  p ‚ÄúThe amount of planning and work that has gone into Storecoin is amazing. Chris and his team have managed to implement a new governance model, based on the one from the United States that has been tested and updated for almost 250 years. Genius. Take existing models that have been updated and stress tested and re-use them,‚Äù said conference attendee Chris Wallwork. ‚ÄúThe best part of Storecoin is what they are doing for transaction speeds, scalability and free transfers. It amazes me how many of the blockchain bottlenecks this group is working to solve.‚Äù

  p Organizer Daniel Gutenberg lauded the level of expertise found in the speakers who appeared.

  p ‚ÄúThe line-up of the conference is second to none,‚Äù Gutenberg said. ‚ÄúI have not heard of any format bringing together so much knowledge in the cryptocurrency and Bitcoin world as the Crypto Finance Conference,‚Äù he told Fintech Finance.
