          p Storecoin is a pre-launch public blockchain protocol therefore, for our Third-Invite Only Token Sale, we are treating Storecoin tokens as securities. This $7.5 Million Sale is aimed only at qualified investors in accordance with laws and regulations of each country that has been authorized to participate.
          p Our Third, Invite-Only Token Sale is subject to KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) checks, as well as some limitations on the number and type of investors per country. We will issue the tokens under relevant regulations for each authorized country.
          p Our aim for Storecoin is to achieve 100,000 wallets in the project before public launch. To accomplish, weâ€™ll be inventing ways to incentivize our community to do work on behalf of the protocol in exchange for token Air-Drops (KYC/AML required).
