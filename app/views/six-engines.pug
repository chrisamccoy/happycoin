To ensure security of the network however, a small security bond is required with each transaction, which is returned to the sender, once the transaction is deemed to be legitimate and not a spam or DDoS attack.

For example if 51% of the circulating token supply is staked by dWorkers, inflationary rewards will be 5%. Rewards are paid out as follows: 80% to process consensus and to scale the blockchain; 20% for on-chain security, on-chain governance, and off-chain blockchain operations – forever.

In order to scale the transaction throughput and make block validation instant with unlimited validator participation, Storecoin introduces a special type of worker called, encrypted agent or eAgent. eAgents validate blocks on behalf of their configured validators. Hundreds of eAgents are run alongside each other in secure containers called Masternodes thus alleviating the need for expensive network calls. So, the blocks are assembled and validated in constant time independent of the number of validators participating in the network. This brings scaling and decentralization, which are typically at the two opposite ends, together.
