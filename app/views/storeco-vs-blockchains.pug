    p.zcash-text.hc-feature-lead.hint-text.see-more-reveal(style="margin-bottom:0px;") The ZCash price of $529 is a snapshot of the price as of December 17th, 2017. The "Filecoin (first hour)" price of $2.25 factors in a 15% discount off of $2.65 (the price during the first hour of the sale) as a result of the 2-year unlocking option. The Tezos price of $0.39 is the effective price paid on the first day of the main sale, taking into account the 20% bonus and an average Bitcoin price of $2,350 on July 1. The EOS price of $8.44 is based on the pre-launch trading price on December 17th, 2017. EOS was assumed to have 5% annual inflation starting at 1 billion tokens.
