    | 's unique governance model, crediting creator Chris McCoy with devising a strategy that engages members of four separate branches in achieving consensus in a democratic process.
  
  p As blockchain approaches practical use in the marketplace, network creators have discovered that a potential threat to their success rests with the people who hold, buy and earn the tokens associated with their platforms.
  
  p Developers have created consensus protocols and algorithms to guard against bad actors on the network and built economic models in an attempt to ensure long-term viability. But only recently has the issue of governance emerged as a key factor in protecting the wider community of users from individuals who care more about financial gain than the ultimate survival of the network.
  
  p Storecoin, a high-throughput, zero-fee blockchain, has created a governance system that McCoy believes will best serve the highest interests of the network. 
  //- His model for that system is the checks and balances structure of the U.S. Constitution. */
  
  p McCoy believes Storecoin will reach global adoption thanks in large part to a governance structure that supports decentralization, engenders trust among participants, and resists censorship.
  
  p Analysts in the industry appear to agree.

    span.italics "Due to the huge economic incentives at stake, getting token-holders to act in the interests of the community, rather than fixating on their own pecuniary gains, is a tall order. Storecoin is a ... blockchain whose most interesting feature is not a technical one â€“ it's a human one,"
