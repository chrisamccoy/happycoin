  p When Storecoin creator Chris McCoy began working on his vision of a p2p programmable payments system, he promised to ‚Äúdo it right.‚Äù That meant linking token sales to milestones attained, publishing the results of research, and developing a network protocol that would ensure decentralization and fee-free transactions.

  p From the beginning, the Storecoin project has been committed to an open dialogue with potential token buyers, app developers, and customers hoping to one day pay for goods and services with a cryptocurrency designed for worldwide acceptance.

  p In a little more than a year, Storecoin anticipates that STORE tokens will be used to transact on the network. By the end of 2019, Storecoin plans to launch its programmable, peer-to-peer currency for global, zero-fee payments. 

  p In the meantime, the Storecoin team wants to empower people all over the world to participate in the Storecoin network.

  p And so, to turn our dedicated followers into a connected community, Storecoin launched its Proof of Community effort in May 2018.

    b About Storecoin
    
  p Storecoin is a new public blockchain with high throughput, true decentralization, and zero transaction fees. The project has eyes on taking on VISA with a faster, zero-fee, programmable, p2p payment system. If Ripple is taking on SWIFT, Storecoin is taking on ACH payments. Structured to become a non-profit at public launch in 2019, the kind of market disruption this new payment approach could inflict on existing financial institutions is momentous. 

  p Storecoin's native currency, STORE, uses a sustainable inflationary monetary policy to achieve zero-fee transaction fees for merchants, developers, and end users. Inflation is dynamically pegged to the number of tokens staked by dWorkers, who are in turn rewarded for contributing resources to the protocol's validation, governance, security, and scalability mechanisms. The rate of inflation grows proportionally to the growth of total value staked, reaching a hard cap at 51% of total supply staked: at this limit, annual token inflation flatlines at 4%.

  p Storecoin strives to take the Web 3.0 ethos one step further, leveraging a unique on-chain governance model of checks and balances.
